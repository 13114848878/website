# Documentation

The documentation for FieldTrip is split into several parts:

* [Tutorial documentation](/tutorial)
* [Walkthrough](/walkthrough)
* [Reference documentation](/reference)
* [Frequently asked questions](/faq)
* [Example MATLAB scripts](/example)

* [Workshop material](/workshop)
* [Video lectures](/video)

* [Method references](/references_to_implemented_methods)
* [Review and teaching material](/references_to_review_papers_and_teaching_material)
* [Publications using FieldTrip](/publications)

* [Template models and data](/template)
* [Realtime BCI](/development/realtime)

 The [tutorials](/tutorial) will help you to get started by providing examples that you can copy-and-paste into Matlab. The [introduction tutorial](/tutorial/introduction) is the best place to start if you do not have any idea about the ideas behind the FieldTrip toolbox. The [Walkthrough](/walkthrough) will give you a good overview of the conceptual ideas behind the toolbox and analysis methods.

In the [reference documentation](/reference/) you find an overview of all main functions in FieldTrip and the [configuration index](/reference/configuration_index) has a list of their configuration options.

The [frequently asked questions](/faq) section provides a lot of practical information. Furthermore, the [example MATLAB scripts](/example) contains pieces of documentation that are often not so elaborate as the tutorials, but that go in more detail into specific aspects of the data, code or analysis.

Sometimes we prepare dedicated course material for [workshops](/workshop), which is also shared on this website, together with [video](/video) recordings of lectures.

If you are very eager to get started with your specific data, please proceed to the user documentation section on importing [your own data](/reading_data).
