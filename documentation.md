# Documentation

The documentation for FieldTrip is split into several parts:

* [Walkthrough](/walkthrough)
* [Getting started](/getting_started)
* [Tutorial documentation](/tutorial)
* [Reference documentation](/reference)
* [Frequently asked questions](/faq)
* [Example matlab scripts](/example)
* [Template models and data](/template)

* [Video lectures](/video)

* [Publications using FieldTrip](/publications)
* [Method references](/references_to_implemented_methods)
* [Review and teaching material](/references_to_review_papers_and_teaching_material)

* [Supported data formats](/dataformat)
* [Importing your data](/reading_data)
* [Workshop material](/workshop)
* [Realtime BCI](/development/realtime)

The [tutorials](/tutorial) will help you to get started by providing examples that you can copy-and-paste into Matlab. The [introduction tutorial](/tutorial/introduction) is the best place to start if you do not have any idea about the ideas behind the FieldTrip toolbox. Also, reading through the [Walkthrough](/walkthrough) will give you a good overview of the ideas behind the toolbox and analysis methods. Sometimes we prepare dedicated course material for [workshops](/workshop), which we also share.

The [frequently asked questions](/faq) section provides a lot of practical information. Furthermore, the [example MATLAB scripts](/example) contains pieces of documentation that are often not so elaborate as the tutorials, but that go in more detail into specific aspects of the data, code or analysis.

If you are very eager to get started with your specific data, please proceed to the user documentation section on importing [your own data](/reading_data). It provides details that are specific to particular data acquisition systems and explains how we deal with system specific peculiarities.

In the [reference documentation](/reference/) you find an overview of all main functions in FieldTrip and the [configuration index](/reference/configuration) has a list of their configuration options.
