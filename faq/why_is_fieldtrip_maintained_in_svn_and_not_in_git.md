# Why was FieldTrip maintained in SVN and not in Git?

{% include markup/info %}
This question does not apply any more.

We started using the [CVS](/development/cvs) version control system for FieldTrip development 2004. In 2009 we switched to [Subversion](/development/svn), motivated by the SPM and EEGLAB teams also using it. In 2016 we switched to [Git](/development/git) and [GitHub](http://github.com) to facilitate collaborations and external contributions.

Please see our [GitHub tutorial](/development/git) for more details.
