## Why was FieldTrip maintained in SVN and not in git?

{% include markup/info %}
This question does not apply any more.
{% include markup/end %}

We started using the [CVS](/development/cvs) version control system for FieldTrip development 2004.
In 2009 we switched to [ Subversion](/development/svn), motivated by the SPM and EEGLAB teams also using it. In 2016 we switched to [git](/development/git) and http://github.com to facilitate collaborations and external contributions.

Please see our [github tutorial](/development/git) for more details.
