## Can I organize my own FieldTrip workshop?

Yes, you can certainly organize your own workshop, training event or hackathon. That could be formatted on the basis of the [video](/video) lectures that we have online, i.e. you would watch them with a group, and discuss them among each other. This could be completed by hands-on sessions on the basis of selected [tutorials](/tutorial), in which also the informal group support is indispensable.

We are willing to support this by an interactive Q&A session (over Skype), by advice on the workshop program and by sharing the slides of previous presentations. Please [contact us](/contact) if you want to discuss your own training.
