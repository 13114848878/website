# Which datasets are used in the documentation and where are they used?

The FieldTrip website and ftp server include a variety of datasets. some of these are used in the [tutorials](/tutorial), while others are used in [example MATLAB scripts](/example). All of these datasets were recorded from humans, unless otherwise specified.

In this [frequently asked question](/faq/open_data) you can find links to other open access datasets.

* There are some additional single-subject raw datasets from this study, which were in the past used to show the effect of the planar gradient transform but which are not used at the moment. These are available from our FTP server as Subject02.zip, Subject03.zip and Subject04.zip. These additional subjects are also used to explain batch processing and distributed computing.

## MEG-visuomotor151

* Right wrist is maintained in isometric extension against a lever until visual stimulus changes speed. Modulation of the hazard rate of the stimulus' speed change: UP-schedule (likelihood of stimulus change *increases* as the duration of the constant stimulus increases) and DOWN-schedule (likelihood of stimulus to change *decreases* a duration of the constant stimulus increases). Analysed change in coherence between oscillations in motor cortex and spinal cord neurons as an indicator of corticospinal interaction.
