# How should I refer to FieldTrip in my publication?

We would appreciate it to be mentioned in your publication if you have used FieldTrip for a considerable part of your analysis.

Please cite the **[FieldTrip Reference Paper](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2011/156869/)** when you have used FieldTrip for data analysis in your study.

Oostenveld, R., Fries, P., Maris, E., Schoffelen, JM (2011). **FieldTrip: Open Source Software for Advanced Analysis of MEG, EEG, and Invasive Electrophysiological Data.** Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 156869, doi:10.1155/2011/156869

Besides referring to the paper, you can use a phrasing like this, where REF corresponds to the reference to the paper.

*  The data analysis was performed using the FieldTrip toolbox for EEG/MEG-analysis (REF; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, the Netherlands. See %%http://fieldtriptoolbox.org%%).
*  The data analysis was performed using the FieldTrip toolbox for EEG/MEG-analysis, developed at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour (REF; %%http://fieldtriptoolbox.org%%).
*  The data analysis was performed using FieldTrip (REF; %%http://fieldtriptoolbox.org%%).

Important is that you refer to the correct web address, so not to %%"www2.ru.nl"%% and not to %%"fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl"%%, but to %%"www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip"%%.
