The FieldTrip tutorials include a lot of smaller datasets that are available for download. These datasets are listed in [this frequently asked question](/faq/what_types_of_datasets_and_their_respective_analyses_are_used_on_fieldtrip).

Note that other MEG/EEG data analysis toolboxes like SPM, MNE, EEGLAB and BrainStorm also share tutorial datasets. 

## Other MEG datasets

The [Human Connectome Project](http://www.humanconnectome.org) contains MEG data from close to 100 subjects, which were scanned on the 248-channel 4D/BTi MEG system at SLU, St Louis. The MEG data includes resting-state and three different experimental tasks, and anatomical, functional (1200 subjects, resting and task) and associated behavioral and demographic data is available. See also [doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.056](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.056) and [doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.046](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.046).

The [Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience](/ https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/) released raw data from the Cam-CAN cohort, including MEG, MRI and cognitive data from approximately 650 males and females uniformly distributed from 18 to 88 years of age. The MEG data (in FIF format) include 3 runs of 1) rest, 2) a sensorimotor task, and 3) a passive sensory task (with separate visual and auditory stimuli). 

The [Open MEG Archive (OMEGA)](https://omega.bic.mni.mcgill.ca) is a collaborative effort by the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre and the Université de Montréal. It consists of a open repository with MEG data. This continuously expanding repository also contains anatomical MRI volumes, demographic and questionnaire information, and eventually will feature other forms of electrophysiological data (e.g. EEG, field, and cell recordings). See also [doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.028](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.028)

The [Kymata Atlas](https://kymata-atlas.org) also shares datasets with electromagnetic measurements of the human cortex done at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit of Cambridge University. The shared data comprises (averaged) EEG and MEG sensor data, and current density reconstructions. The participants are healthy human adults listening to the radio and/or watching films.

Wakeman and Henson have shared [A multi-subject, multi-modal human neuroimaging dataset](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20151) that includes raw MEG and EEG data from 16 subjects. This data also forms the basis for the SPM documentation.

## Other EEG datasets

The [BNCI Horizon 2020 consortium](http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets) hosts a repository of datasets from brain-computer interface (BCI) and decoding experiments available for free download. The datasets include EEG, fNIRS, and ECoG data collected mainly by the consortium partners in several European countries.

The [Brain Signals](http://www.brainsignals.de) website has a list of references to shared EEG data sets.

Arno Delorme maintains a list of [Open EEG datasets](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~arno/fam2data/publicly_available_EEG_data.html).

Brad Voytek maintains a list of [Open Datasets in Human Electrophysiology](https://github.com/voytekresearch/OpenData).

## Other ECoG datasets

Kahana and Rizutto have released [EGoG data from 251 subjects](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/RAM_Public_Data) collected during Phase I and II of the Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project. The dataset includes information from 700 sessions, and for every patient, intracranial recording files from 100 to 200 electrode channels, neuro-anatomical information indicating the location of each electrode, precise records of patient behavior and the experimental design documents.

## Other LFP and spike datasets

A collection of intracranial animal datasets is shared on the [Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience](http://crcns.org/) data sharing website.
