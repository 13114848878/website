## What kind of dataformats can I read in?

FieldTrip provides support for data files from CTF, Neuromag, BTI/4D-Neuroimaging, Yokogawa, BrainVision, Neuroscan, Biosemi, EEProbe, BESA, Neuralynx, Plexon and other electrophysiology data acquisition systems. Note that new dataformats are being added all the time, so the information here is likely to be outdated. There is a separate page on [supported data formats](/dataformat), please look there for more details.
