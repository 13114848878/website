# What kind of dataformats can I read in?

FieldTrip provides support for CTF, Neuromag/Elekta, BTI/4D-Neuroimaging, Yokogawa/Ricoh, BrainVision, Neuroscan, Biosemi, ANT, EEProbe, BESA, Neuralynx, Plexon and other electrophysiology data acquisition systems. Note that new dataformats are being added all the time, so the list here is likely outdated.
