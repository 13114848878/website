# About the FieldTrip project

FieldTrip is being developed and maintained at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](http://www.ru.nl/donders), part of the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in close collaboration with [collaborating institutes](/external_links#collaborating_institutes). The development of FieldTrip currently receives support from [the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)](http://www.nwo.nl) and has previously been supported by the [ChildBrain](http://www.childbrain.eu) project, the [Human Connectome](http://humanconnectome.org) project and by [BrainGain](http://www.braingain.nl).

The development is led by Robert Oostenveld and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, and receives many valuable contributions from present and past colleagues from the Donders and many contributors over the world.
