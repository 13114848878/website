FieldTrip is being developed and maintained by a team of researchers at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](http://www.ru.nl/donders), led by Robert Oostenveld and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, in collaboration with many researchers over the world.

If you have questions about the **use of FieldTrip**, you should post them on the [email discussion list](/discussion_list).

If you want to **report a malfunctioning** of the FieldTrip code, please use our [bugzilla](/bugzilla) bug tracking system. The easier it is for one of the developers to reproduce the bug, the more likely it is that we can fix the problem for you. Good bug reports include a small test script and the data (i.e. mat file) required to reproduce the bug.

For questions that are **not suitable** for the public email list, e.g. discussing potential contributions to the toolbox or requests for organizing a local workshop, you can send an email to Robert Oostenveld (robert.oostenveld at donders.ru.nl) or Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen (jan.schoffelen at donders.ru.nl).

If you like FieldTrip, you can **show your appreciation** by sending a postcard to:
