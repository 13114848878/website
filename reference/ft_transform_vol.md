 FT_TRANSFORM_VOL applies a homogenous coordinate transformation to
 a structure with an EEG or MEG colume conduction model. The homogenous
 transformation matrix should be limited to a rigid-body translation
 plus rotation and a global rescaling.

 Use as
   headmodel = ft_transform_vol(transform, headmodel)
