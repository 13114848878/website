##  PEERLIST

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help peerlist".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/peerlist>``<font color=green>`PEERLIST`</font>``</a>` gives information about all peers in the network, e.g. the
    number of slaves, their network configuration, etc.
 
    Use as
    peerlist
    to get a summary of the information displayed on screen, or
    list = peerlist
    to get all information represented in a structure.
 
    See also `<a href=/reference/peerinfo>``<font color=green>`PEERINFO`</font>``</a>`
