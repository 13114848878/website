##  PEEREXEC

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help peerexec".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/peerexec>``<font color=green>`PEEREXEC`</font>``</a>` is the low-level function that executes the job on the
    slave. It also tries to change the path and pwd to those on the
    master and it catches and deals with any errors in the code that
    is executed.
 
    This function should not be called directly.
 
    See also `<a href=/reference/peerslave>``<font color=green>`PEERSLAVE`</font>``</a>`, `<a href=/reference/peermaster>``<font color=green>`PEERMASTER`</font>``</a>`, `<a href=/reference/peercellfun>``<font color=green>`PEERCELLFUN`</font>``</a>`
