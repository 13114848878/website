##  BCIFUN_LATIDX

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help bcifun_latidx".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/bcifun_latidx>``<font color=green>`BCIFUN_LATIDX`</font>``</a>` extracts alpha power, computes the alpha lateralization index 
    and sends a command to an external device
 
    This function computes the lateralization index log(A/B) for the
    average alpha power in right channels A and the average alpha power
    in left channels B. In a covert attention experiment we expect
    higher values for attention to the right visual hemifield and lower
    values for attention to the left visual hemifield.
