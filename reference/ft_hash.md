##  FT_HASH

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help ft_hash".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/ft_hash>``<font color=green>`FT_HASH`</font>``</a>` computes a MD5 hash from a MATLAB variable or structure
 
    It will first try a hashing algorithm implemented as a mex file.
    If that fails, it falls back to a slower one that is based on Java.
