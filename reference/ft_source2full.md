##  FT_SOURCE2FULL

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help ft_source2full".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/ft_source2full>``<font color=green>`FT_SOURCE2FULL`</font>``</a>` recreates the grid locations outside the brain in the source 
    reconstruction, so that the source volume again describes the full grid.
    This undoes the memory savings that can be achieved using `<a href=/reference/ft_source2sparse>``<font color=green>`FT_SOURCE2SPARSE`</font>``</a>`
    and makes it possible again to plot  the source volume and save it to an
    external file.
 
    Use as
    [source] = ft_source2full(source)
 
    See also `<a href=/reference/ft_source2sparse>``<font color=green>`FT_SOURCE2SPARSE`</font>``</a>`
