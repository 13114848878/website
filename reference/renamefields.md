##  RENAMEFIELDS

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help renamefields".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/renamefields>``<font color=green>`RENAMEFIELDS`</font>``</a>` renames a selection of the fields in a structure
 
    Use as
    b = renamefields(a, old, new)
    which renames the fields with the old name to the new name. Fields that
    are specified but not present will be silently ignored.
 
    See also `<a href=/reference/copyfields>``<font color=green>`COPYFIELDS`</font>``</a>`, `<a href=/reference/keepfields>``<font color=green>`KEEPFIELDS`</font>``</a>`, `<a href=/reference/removefields>``<font color=green>`REMOVEFIELDS`</font>``</a>`
