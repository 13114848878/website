##  RESIDUALVARIANCE

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help residualvariance".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/residualvariance>``<font color=green>`RESIDUALVARIANCE`</font>``</a>` scan with a single dipole and computes the RV
    at each grid location.
 
    Use as
    [dipout] = residualvariance(dip, grad, headmodel, dat, ...)
`</pre>``</html>`
