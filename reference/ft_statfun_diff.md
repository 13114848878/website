##  FT_STATFUN_DIFF

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help ft_statfun_diff".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/ft_statfun_diff>``<font color=green>`FT_STATFUN_DIFF`</font>``</a>` computes the difference of the mean in two conditions. Although it
    can be used for statistical testing, it is not very usefull since it will have
    rather limited sensitivity.
    
    The purpose of this function is to show you an example on how to write a statfun
    that expresses the difference in the data between two conditions. You can use such
    a function with the statistical framework in FieldTrip to perform a simple (or more
    complex) permutation test, without having to worry about the representation of the
    data.
 
    See also `<a href=/reference/ft_statfun_mean>``<font color=green>`FT_STATFUN_MEAN`</font>``</a>` for another example function
