##  FT_POSTAMBLE

Note that this reference documentation is identical to the help that is displayed in MATLAB when you type "help ft_postamble".

`<html>``<pre>`
    `<a href=/reference/ft_postamble>``<font color=green>`FT_POSTAMBLE`</font>``</a>` is a helper function that is included in many of the FieldTrip
    functions and which takes care of some general settings and operations at the end
    of the function.
 
    This ft_postamble m-file is a function, but internally it executes a number of
    private scripts in the callers workspace. This allows the private script to access
    the variables in the callers workspace and behave as if the script were included as
    a header file in C-code.
