# Support

The development of the FieldTrip project (i.e. the software, the documentation on this website, but also everything around it) is headed by the [Donders Institute](http://www.ru.nl/donders), part of the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl) in Nijmegen. The project has received and continues to receive many valuable contributions from collaborating researchers from all over the worlds and from its community of users.

If you have questions about the use of FieldTrip, please ask them on the [email discussion list](/discussion_list). The developers in general do not have time to address individual's questions. The community at large includes a much broader pool of expertise w.r.t. neuroscientific topics, experimental designs, specific data acquisition systems, and analysis strategies. Also, by sharing the questions and answers on a public forum, many more people benefit.

If you get a MATLAB error when using FieldTrip and you suspect that it is not due to you specifying the incorrect options to the function, but that it is due to a bug in the implementation of the software, please report it as an [issue](/development/issues) on GitHub.
