# Support

The best way to get support is to ask to the community of users and developers. If you have questions, please ask them on the [discussion list](/discussion_list).

Another way is by attending one of the upcoming [workshops](/workshop) or by watching the [online video lectures](/video) that were recorded at previous workshops.

We also have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/), which shows [photos](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/photos/), for example of past workshops, and where [events](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/events/) are announced occasionally. Of course, you can also 'like' us. Note that we are not actively providing support through the Facebook page, please use the [discussion list](/discussion_list) for that.
