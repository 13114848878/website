To get direct access to the code, please refer to the [Git and GitHub](/development/git) documentation.

The source code in the FieldTrip toolbox is split over multiple directories reflecting its [modular organization](/development/module). The modular organization facilitates a separation between end-user functions that also do data bookkeeping, and low level functions that focus on the algorithms.

For keeping track of new ideas, feature requests and bugs, we still use [Bugzilla](/bugzilla) but are slowly moving over to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip).

For many of the tools (GitHub, website, mailman, Twitter, Facebook) that we use we have made an [integration](/development/integration); e.g. an update on the website is automatically tweeted.

## Recent improvements to the code

All changes to the code can be tracked on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/fieldtriptoolbx) and [GitHub](/development/git).
