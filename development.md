# Development

The source code in the FieldTrip toolbox is split over multiple directories reflecting the [modular organization](/development/modules). The modular organization facilitates a separation between end-user functions that also do data bookkeeping, and low level functions that focus on the algorithms.

For keeping track of new ideas, feature requests and bugs, we still use [bugzilla](/bugzilla) but are slowly moving over to [github issues](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip).

For many of the tools (github, wiki, mailman, twitter, facebook) that we use we have made an  [integration](/development/integration), e.g. an update on the wiki is automatically tweeted.

## Recent improvements to the code

All changes to the code can be tracked on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/fieldtriptoolbx) and [github](/development/git).
