<div class="warning">
The purpose of this page is just to serve as todo or scratch pad for the development project and to list and share some ideas. 

After making changes to the code and/or documentation, this page should remain on the wiki as a reminder of what was done and how it was done. However, there is no guarantee that this page is updated in the end to reflect the final state of the project

So chances are that this page is considerably outdated and irrelevant. The notes here might not reflect the current state of the code, and you should **not use this as serious documentation**.
</div>

at the moment, people are supposed to call warp_apply, whereas elsewhere in the code transform_xxx is used (with xxx=vol/sens/headshape). It makes sense to also implement a transform_grid. Furthermore, a grid structure should be detected as such (i.e. datatype should know what a grid is).

Do we also need a griddtype function?

What is the relation between a source and a grid structure?
