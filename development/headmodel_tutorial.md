The purpose of this page is just to serve as a scratch pad for the new version of a tutorial site.

There is no guarantee that this page is updated in the end to reflect the final state of the tutorial site.
So chances are that this page is considerably outdated and irrelevant. The notes here might not reflect the current state of the code, and you should **not use this as serious documentation**.
