 2.  Something about IIR vs FIR in general (?, or discuss with each of the filter types?)
 3.  fir1 has xxx advantages and xxx disadvantages
 4.  (+ same for firws, but, firls)
 5.  Filter order/passband/cutoff/rolloff explanation
 6.  Depending on what you want (Hilbert, remove drift, remove high freq noise, or xxx), yyy might be the best filter type for you
