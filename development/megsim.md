<div class="warning">
The purpose of this page is just to serve as todo or scratch pad for the development project and to list and share some ideas. 

After making changes to the code and/or documentation, this page should remain on the wiki as a reminder of what was done and how it was done. However, there is no guarantee that this page is updated in the end to reflect the final state of the project

So chances are that this page is considerably outdated and irrelevant. The notes here might not reflect the current state of the code, and you should **not use this as serious documentation**.

On http://portal.mind.unm.edu/megsim/simdata there is a complete set of simulated(?) data. It would be nice to use that data in a tutorial. Probably it means that we'll also have to add support for that particular data format.
