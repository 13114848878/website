### 11 June, 2020

Robert and Jan-Mathijs have made an improvement to how color schemes can be specified. In functions supporting cfg.colormap, you can now also specify a subset of the color schemes that are in matplotlib, as well as the brewermap color schemes (e.g. 'RdBu'). See **ft_colormap](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/plotting/ft_colormap.m)** for more information. Happy plotting!
