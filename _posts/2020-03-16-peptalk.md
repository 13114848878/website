### 16 March, 2020

Dear friends and colleagues, on behalf of the FieldTrip team we would like to say bon courage to all of you, and keep up the good spirit. Right now most of public life has ground to a halt in the Netherlands, like in most European countries. Many of us will probably be working from home in the coming period. We will try to stay operational as much as possible. Keep your head cool, and take care of yourself and each other. Jan-Mathijs and Robert
