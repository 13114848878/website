# BIDS - the brain imaging data structure

FieldTrip can read data from all MEG, EEG, iEEG and MRI file formats that are supported in BIDS. Furthermore, includes the **[data2bids](/reference/data2bids)** function to convert data to the BIDS structure. This function can convert data formats if needed, and it writes the accompanying metadata about channels, coordinates, events, etcetera to the .json and .tsv sidecar files.
