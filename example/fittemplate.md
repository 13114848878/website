# Individualizing a template volume conduction to on the basis of surface information

## Introduction

This example script demonstrates how to construct an individualized template
volume conduction model on the basis of a surface scan.

###  Background

The quality of EEG source estimates depends on accurate volume conduction
models and sensor positions. The volume conduction model comprises a description of the geometry, of the conductivities and of a computational approach for solving Poisson's equations.

The current golden standard is to measure the head geometry with an MRI
and on the basis of that to create a volume conduction model. However,
this data is not always available. Therefore, the usage of surface scan's
can come in hand. In this tutorial we will describe how to use surface
scan to create an individualized template volume conduction model.

## Download

For this the tutorial we will use
[this](ftp://ftp.fieldtriptoolbox.org/pub/fieldtrip/tutorial/epilepsy)
dataset. More information on this dataset can be found
[here](/tutorial/epilepsy/).
Also we need an external toolbox which can be downloaded [here](https://sites.google.com/site/myronenko/research/cpd)

## Loading and coregistering data

Before starting with FieldTrip, it is important that you set up your
[MATLAB path](/faq/should_i_add_fieldtrip_with_all_subdirectories_to_my_matlab_path) properly.

Then you can load the data head shape measured with the Polhemus and a
template volume conduction model. Also we will convert the units into mm
by now.

    polhemus = ft_read_headshape(filename);
    polhemus = ft_convert_units(polhemus,'mm');

template = ft_read_vol('standard_bem.mat');
template = ft_convert_units(template,'mm');
## Coregistration

In the next step we coregister both meshes with each other.
cfg = [];

    cfg.template.headshape      = polhemus;
    cfg.checksize               = inf;
    cfg.individual.headmodel    = template;
    cfg                         = ft_interactiverealign(cfg);
    template                    = ft_transform_geometry(cfg.m,template);

## Create surface meshes with shared features

For creating the individualized mesh it is important that the head
surface of template only contains features that are also in the head
surface measurement of the Polhemus. Therefore, we use ft_defacemesh to remove the undesired features.

    defaced_template                = template;
    cfg                             = [];
    defaced_template.bnd(1).unit    = 'mm';
    defaced                         =  ft_defacemesh(cfg,defaced_template.bnd(1));

    defaced_template.bnd(1).pos = defaced.pos;
    defaced_template.bnd(1).tri = defaced.tri;

## Fitting template to Polhemus measurement

We will now use the surface information of the template model and the
Polhemus measurement to create an individualised version mesh of the template mesh.

    cfg             = [];
    cfg.headshape   = polhemus;
    cfg.template    = defaced_template.bnd(1);
    cfg.method      = 'fittemplate';
    fitted          = ft_prepare_mesh(cfg, template.bnd);

## Creating volume conduction model

Finally we will create a volume conduction model.

    cfg = [];
    cfg.method = 'bemcp';
    headmodel_bem = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, fitted);
