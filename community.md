# FieldTrip Community

FieldTrip's community is organised for a large part around its [discussion list](/discussion_list) and the wiki you are currently browsing.

FieldTrip is not the only analysis toolbox or software package out there. We collaborate with many open source research groups and with various companies, exchanging ideas and source code.
