# FieldTrip Community

FieldTrip's community is organised for a large part around its [discussion list](/discussion_list) and the wiki you are currently browsing. The FieldTrip project (i.e. software, documentation, website, and everything around it) receives many valuable contributions from its community. Please [look here](/contribute) how you can contribute.

We also have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/), which shows [photos](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/photos/), for example of past workshops, and where [events](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/events/) are announced occasionally. Of course, you can also 'like' us:

# The larger community

FieldTrip is not the only analysis toolbox or software package out there. We collaborate with many open source research groups and with various companies, exchanging ideas and source code.
