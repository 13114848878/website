# FieldTrip Community

FieldTrip's community is organised for a large part around its [discussion list](/discussion_list) and the wiki you are currently browsing. The FieldTrip project (i.e. software, documentation, website, and everything around it) receives many valuable contributions from its community. Please [look here](/contribute) how you can contribute.

We also have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/), which shows [photos](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/photos/), for example of past workshops, and where [events](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/events/) are announced occasionally. Of course, you can also 'like' us:

# Support

The best way to get support is to ask your questions to the community of users and developers on the [discussion list](/discussion_list).

Another way is by attending one of the upcoming [workshops](/workshop).

You can also watch the [online video lectures](/video) that were recorded at previous workshops.

## The larger community

FieldTrip is not the only analysis toolbox or software package out there. We collaborate with many open source research groups and with various companies, exchanging ideas and source code.
