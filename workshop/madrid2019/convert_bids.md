% 1) the name of the dataset
% 2) the level of sedation at which the dataset was acquired (1 = baseline, 2 = mild sedation, 3 = moderate sedation, 4 = recovery)
% 3) the concentration of propofol measured in blood plasma at that level (in microgram/litre)
% 4) the average reaction times measured in a speeded two-choice response task administered at that level (in milliseconds)
% 5) the number of correct responses in that task (out of a max of 40)

% After the initial conversion of the EEG data files, I used
% https://github.com/robertoostenveld/bids-tools to make the additional metadata
% files and used the following code to update the scans.tsv files

for isub=1:numel(subject)

  % find the 4 datasets for this subject
  sel = find(startsWith(datainfo(:,1), subject{isub}));
  num = numel(sel);

  dataset           = datainfo(sel,1);    % keep this as cell-array with strings
  sedation          = [datainfo{sel,2}];  % convert this to a numeric array
  concentration     = [datainfo{sel,3}];
  reactiontime      = [datainfo{sel,4}];
  correctresponses  = [datainfo{sel,5}];

  sub       = sprintf('sub-%s', subject{isub});
  filename = fullfile(bidsroot, sub, [sub '_scans.tsv']);

  t = readtable(filename, 'FileType', 'text', 'Delimiter', '\t');

  % add the subject-specific information
  t.sedation       = level(sedation);
  t.concentration  = concentration(:);
  t.reactiontime  = reactiontime(:);
  t.correctresponses = correctresponses(:);

  writetable(t, filename, 'FileType', 'text', 'Delimiter', '\t');
