# Details on the EEG language dataset

Full details are available in the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014465) by Simanova et al.

Continuous EEG was registered using a 64 channel ActiCap system (Brain Products GmbH) filtered at 0.2â€“200 Hz and sampled at 500 Hz with the BrainVision Recorder Professional software (Brain Products GmbH). An equidistant electrode cap was used to position 60 electrodes on the scalp. EEG data were recorded against the reference at the right mastoid; an additional electrode measured the voltage on the left mastoid.

Stimuli consisted of concepts from three semantic categories: two relevant categories (animals, tools) and a task category that varied across subjects, either clothing or vegetables. All concepts were presented in three modalities: auditory (spoken Dutch words), visual (black line drawings on white background) and orthographical (written Dutch words, black letters on white background).
