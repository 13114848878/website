# Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit at the Donders

On 8-12 April 2019 we will host the “Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit” at the Donders Institute in Nijmegen.

This intense 5-day toolkit course will teach you advanced MEG and EEG data analysis skills. Preprocessing, frequency analysis, source reconstruction, connectivity and various statistical methods will be covered. The toolkit will consist of a number of lectures, followed by hands-on sessions in which you will be tutored through the complete analysis of MEG and EEG data sets, and there will also be plenty of opportunity to interact and ask questions to us about your research and data. On the final day you will have the opportunity to work on your own dataset under supervision of the tutors.

Organizer: Robert Oostenveld, with the help of many colleagues.

Preregistration is open until 3 March 2019. Please go to [this page](https://www.ru.nl/donders/agenda/donders-tool-kits/vm-tool-kits/donders-meg-eeg-toolkit/) for registration information.
