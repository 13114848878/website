# Download the FieldTrip toolbox

You can download the FieldTrip toolbox [here](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download.php).

Prior to downloading, you might want to check whether your computer meets the [MATLAB requirements](/faq/requirements).

After downloading the toolbox, you unzip it and add the directory in which all the *.m files are located to your path. See also [this question](/faq/should_i_add_fieldtrip_with_all_subdirectories_to_my_matlab_path) about setting up the MATLAB path.

You can download the tutorial data [here](ftp://ftp.fieldtriptoolbox.org/pub/fieldtrip/tutorial).
