# Discussion List

The aim of the FieldTrip [email discussion list](http://mailman.science.ru.nl/mailman/listinfo/fieldtrip) is to facilitate the discussion between both users and developers of the FieldTrip toolbox, to share experiences and to discuss new ideas for MEG and EEG analysis. New releases and updates will also be announced through that list.

Please send an email to fieldtrip-subscribe@science.ru.nl to subscribe or to fieldtrip-unsubscribe@science.ru.nl to unsubscribe to the FieldTrip list. Only people who are subscribed to the discussion list will be able to receive and post messages.
