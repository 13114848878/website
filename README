# FieldTrip website

This repository contains the content that is hosted on http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org

## Technical notes
- Pages that contain tags must have a title.
- Variables passed in an include must be specified in quotes.
- code blocks should have an empty line before and after them.
- Shared pages should go in _include/shared.

## Ideas
- for image resizing we might consider a service like https://www.imgix.com or https://images.weserv.nl
- use code highlighting from https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting
