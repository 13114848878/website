## Technical notes
- Pages that contain tags must have a title.
- Variables passed in an include must be specified in quotes.
- Code blocks should have an empty line before and after them.
- Shared pages should go in _include/shared.
- MarkDown documentation can be found on https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.
- Liquid documentation can be found on https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid.

## Ideas
- For image resizing we might consider a service like https://www.imgix.com or https://images.weserv.nl.
- Use code highlighting from https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting.
