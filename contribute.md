# Contribute

FieldTrip is an [Open Source](http://www.opensource.org) project with contributions from various individual users and research groups.

There are various ways in which ***you can contribute*** to FieldTrip.

## Share your expertise

The FieldTrip community is organised around the [email discussion list](/discussion_list). You can contribute your expertise by helping other people, answering questions from other people on the email list, or post your ideas.

## Contribute documentation

You are invited to add your own tutorials, example scripts or answers to frequently asked questions. Every time you type an email explaining something about FieldTrip, please consider whether you could add it to this website for others to learn from as well.

You can contribute directly to the documentation on this website by going to [github](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website), edit or add a page there and send your suggestion as a "pull request". All contributions are reviewed by the maintainers, so if you are not sure about the quality of your contribution, just submit it to us and we will check, improve and/or provide feedback if needed.

When you add documentation, please consider the [documentation guidelines](/development/guidelines/documentation) to keep it consistent with other documentation and to facilitate cross-linking. 

## Request enhancements

Good ideas on improving the toolbox are always welcome. You can request for [improvements of the code](/bugzilla) or new functionality. We cannot guarantee that we have time to implement it, but it is good to know what people would like to do with FieldTrip.

## Report bugs

You can [provide us with detailed bug reports](/bugzilla). The easier it is for one of us to reproduce the bug, the more likely it is that we can fix the problem. Good bug reports include a small testscript and the data (i.e. mat file) required to reproduce the bug.

## Contribute code

You can contribute by sharing your MATLAB source code with us and help us integrate it into the FieldTrip toolbox. To get direct access to the code, please refer to the [git and github](/development/git) documentation.

On the [development section of this wiki](/development) you can find more details on how the development is organized. You can of course also [ask](/contact). When you want to contribute code, please consider the [code guidelines](/development/guidelines/code) to keep it consistent and compatible with the existing implementation. Also try to adhere to the existing representation of the data in the [data structures](/faq/how_are_the_various_data_structures_defined).
