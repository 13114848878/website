# Template MEG dewar shapes

To help position the subject in the MEG dewar (i.e. the helmet), you can use **[ft_realtime_headlocalizer](/reference/ft_realtime_headlocalizer)** in combination with the FieldTrip [realtime interface](/development/realtime). The head localizer allows you to visualize the following geometrie

*  head localizer coils
*  realistic head shape, recorded with Polhemus or Structure Sensor
*  schematic outline of the head as a sphere
*  MEG sensor positions
*  dewar outline

Template dewar outlines are available for the CTF and the Elekta system and will be loaded automatically.
